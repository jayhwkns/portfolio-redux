Squigley is a 2D platformer that I developed during my freshman year of
college. Though far from a perfect game, it was a project I was determined
to see through to the end.

The game was developed using **Unity 2D** and **C#**, which helped reinforce
the object-oriented programming paradigm that I was learning in my classes.
I went into college hoping computer science would teach me everything I
needed to build projects like video games as a hobby. Working on *Squigley*
during my first year really got me excited to learn more and improve my skills.

Being a solo developer, I also did most of the art and music, though I also
collaborated with some friends back home I was in a band with for the song that
plays during the end-credits. This was the biggest music recording and
composition project I've done to date.
